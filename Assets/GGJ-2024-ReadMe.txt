	This game is attempting to emulate the gameplay of MonkeyBall. The objective will be to roll the marble around in a comedian's head collecting the elements of a joke to deliver the full joke to a crowd. 

Log:

	1/25 - Movement: Attempting to move arena and player/marble will roll across using Unity built in physics. Currently running into an issue where the player/marble is getting stuck. May change this movement to adding force to the player directly.
